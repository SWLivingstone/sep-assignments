1. Spatial Locality is the "location" of items
relative to eachother.  For example in an array
items are located next to eachother and have a
given index relative to the entire array.  In
a linked list items can be located anywhere and
are only conected to eachother via the previous
item in the list.


2. I ran Benchmark in speed_test.rb

The array was much faster in each operation.
However, the amount of active memory used for
list would be far less.
