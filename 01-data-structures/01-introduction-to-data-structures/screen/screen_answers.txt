1. I used an series of nested arrays to create
a grid
[
[[],[],[],[],[],[],]
[[],[],[],[],[],[],]
[[],[],[],[],[],[],]
[[],[],[],[],[],[],]
]

In this way each pixel can be accessed with in
the array using array[x][y] to find a given
pixel at a given x and y.  Arrays are very
easy to work with in terms of manipulating data
so a devloper can easily update pixels at will.

2.  A developer can find a given pixel by
using its x and y axis values

3. This could work for:
  - Chess board (most board games really)
  - mapping with a grid
  - creating an graphed matrix
