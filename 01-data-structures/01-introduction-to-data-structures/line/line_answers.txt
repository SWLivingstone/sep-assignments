1. My data structure allows for the simple
manipulation of a line.  A developer is able
to add and remove from the line as well as
to search the line by name and position (first,
last, middle).

2. A specific item can be searched for by name.

3. This data structure could represent any que
or order.  It could also represent a leader
board so long as no ties are permited.  It could
represent the order in which to do something.
