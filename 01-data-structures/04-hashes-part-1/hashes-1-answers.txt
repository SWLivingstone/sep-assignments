On a small scale doubling the size of an array
to handle a collision is quick and simple however
if the list of items were to scale up it could
become quite expensive.  Not only is more memory
required to hold a larger array but it could be
waisted space. For example if you have an array
length of 256 containing 100 hashed items and
a collision occured when adding a new item
the array would then be doubled to 512 leaving
us with an array length of 512 and only 101
hashed items.  The array would then be 5 times 
larger than necessary.
